### **II. Software Test Plan (STP)**

This STP serves as the **overall roadmap for testing**, detailing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule.

#### **1. Scope of Testing**

**Testing Goals**

**Functional Goals**:

- **[P0]** Verify multi-arch image matching architecture with pull method Pod
  - Import succeeds when using `spec.registry.pullMethod: pod` with `spec.registry.platform.architecture: arm64`
  - Correct architecture-specific image layers are pulled from multi-arch registry

- **[P0]** Verify multi-arch image matching architecture with pull method Node
  - Import succeeds when using `spec.registry.pullMethod: node` with correct architecture
  - Import pod is scheduled on node matching the target architecture

- **[P0]** Validate DataSource pointing to another DataSource
  - DataSource chaining works correctly (DataSource → DataSource reference)
  - Architecture information is preserved through DataSource chain

- **[P1]** Verify multi-arch image import fails gracefully with absent architecture
  - Import fails with clear error when requesting architecture not present in multi-arch image
  - For pull method Pod: import fails with appropriate error message
  - For pull method Node: import pod gets "Unschedulable" condition when no matching nodes exist
