### **II. Software Test Plan (STP)**

This STP serves as the **overall roadmap for testing**, detailing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule.

#### **1. Scope of Testing**

<!-- Briefly describe what will be tested. The scope must **cover functional and non-functional requirements**.
Must ensure user stories are included and aligned to downstream user stories from Section I. -->

**Testing Goals**

<!-- Define specific, measurable testing objectives for this feature using **SMART criteria**
(Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).
Each goal should tie back to requirements from Section I and be independently verifiable.
**How to Define Good Testing Goals:**
- **Specific**: Clearly state what will be tested (not "test the feature" but "validate VM live migration
  with SR-IOV networks")
- **Measurable**: Define quantifiable success criteria (e.g., "95% of VM migrations complete within xxx seconds")
- **Achievable**: Realistic given resources and timeline
- **Relevant**: Directly supports feature acceptance criteria and user stories
- **Verifiable**: Can be objectively confirmed as complete
**Priority Levels:**
- **P0**: Blocking GA - must be complete before release
- **P1**: High priority - required for full feature coverage
- **P2**: Nice-to-have - can be deferred if timeline constraints exist -->

<!-- **Example - Functional Goals**:
- **[P0]** Verify VM live migration completes successfully with new network binding plugin across
  OVN-Kubernetes and secondary networks
- **[P1]** Validate hotplug/hotunplug operations work with new storage class without VM restart
- **[P0]** Confirm RBAC permissions model correctly restricts non-admin users from accessing
  cluster-wide configuration API
- **[P2]** Validate new metrics with real-time VM performance data (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O)
**Example - Quality Goals**:
- **[P0]** Verify VM live migration completes in <30 seconds for VMs with <8GB memory
  (performance baseline from VEP-XXXX)
- **[P1]** Confirm feature operates correctly in disconnected/air-gapped environments with local
  image registry
- **[P0]** Validate zero data loss during live migration under network latency up to 100ms
**Example - Integration Goals**:
- **[P0]** Verify backward compatibility: upgrade from OCP 4.19 to 4.20 preserves existing VM
  configurations without manual intervention
- **[P0]** Confirm interoperability with OpenShift Service Mesh when VMs use Istio sidecar injection
- **[P1]** Test integration with OpenShift monitoring stack: metrics appear in Prometheus,
  alerts fire correctly in Alertmanager -->

**Functional Goals**:

- **[P0]** Verify multi-arch image matching architecture with pull method Pod

- **[P0]** Verify multi-arch image matching architecture with pull method Node

- **[P0]** Validate DataSource pointing to another DataSource
