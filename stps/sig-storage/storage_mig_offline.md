  - *Describe the feature's value to customers:* Enables customers to perform storage migration for offline VMs without requiring them to be running, providing flexibility in storage management operations.
  - *List the customer use cases identified:* Storage migration for mixed offline VMs and running VMs in one migration plan, allowing batch migration operations regardless of VM state.

- [x] **Testability**
  <!-- Confirmed requirements are **testable and unambiguous**. -->
  - *Note any requirements that are unclear or untestable:* Requirements are testable. Downstream build with the feature code is available for testing.

- [x] **Acceptance Criteria**
  <!-- Acceptance criteria are the specific, verifiable conditions that must be met for the feature to be considered complete — they define *how we know it works*.
  Example: "VM migrates without network downtime exceeding 500ms", "VM deletion is blocked for non-admin users." -->
  - *List the acceptance criteria:*
    - Storage migration completes successfully for offline VMs
    - Storage migration completes successfully for mixed offline VMs and running VMs in a single migration plan
    - Storage migration completes successfully for offline VMs with hotplug disk

  - *List applicable NFRs and their targets:* Documentation updates to reflect offline VM storage migration support
  - *Note any NFRs not covered and why:* Performance and scale testing are not required for this feature

#### **2. Known Limitations**

The limitations are documented to ensure alignment between development, QA, and product teams.
The following topics will not be tested or supported.

<!-- Document any known limitations, constraints, or trade-offs in the feature implementation or testing approach.

**Examples:**
Feature related:
- The feature is only supports YYY storage class
- Feature does not support IPv6 (only IPv4)
- No support for ARM64 architecture in this release
- The feature is incompatible with ZZZ feature

Tests related:
- CPU xxx will not be tested due to lack of hardware
- Integration with [Third-Party Service] is excluded; all external calls will be mocked using static data-->

None identified at this time.

#### **3. Technology and Design Review**

<!-- **How to complete this checklist:**
1. **Checkbox**: Mark [x] if done
2. Complete the relevant, needed details for the checklist item -->

- [x] **Developer Handoff/QE Kickoff**
  <!-- A meeting where Dev/Arch walked QE through the design, architecture, and implementation details. **Critical for identifying untestable aspects early.**-->
  - *Key takeaways and concerns:* Extend the offline VMs storage migration support

- [x] **Technology Challenges**
  <!-- Identified potential testing challenges related to the underlying technology.-->
  - *List identified challenges:* Offline VMs initiate migration through CDI clone of the source PVC 
  - *Impact on testing approach:* Test cases must verify both offline VM migration mixed scenarios with both offline and running VMs in the same migration plan. 

- [x] **API Extensions**
  <!-- Review new or modified APIs and their impact on testing. Covers both new tests for new APIs and updates to existing tests for modified APIs.
  Example: "New VirtualMachineSnapshot API v1beta2 — 3 new endpoints, 1 modified endpoint. Existing snapshot tests need updating." -->
  - *List new or modified APIs:* No new APIs - extends existing migration plan API to handle offline VMs
  - *Testing impact:* No API test updates required; functional tests will verify new behavior

- [x] **Test Environment Needs**
  <!-- Identified whether special environment setups are needed beyond standard infrastructure.-->
  - *See environment requirements in Section II.3 and testing tools in Section II.3.1*

- [x] **Topology Considerations**
  <!-- Evaluated multi-cluster, network topology, and architectural impacts.-->
  - *Describe topology requirements:* Standard 3-master/3-worker cluster sufficient
  - *Impact on test design:* No special topology requirements

### **II. Software Test Plan (STP)**

This STP serves as the **overall roadmap for testing**, detailing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule.

#### **1. Scope of Testing**

<!-- Briefly describe what will be tested. The scope must **cover functional and non-functional requirements**.
Must ensure user stories are included and aligned to downstream user stories from Section I. -->

**Testing Goals**

<!-- Testing goals are specific, measurable objectives — they say *what* must be verified and *how* success is measured.

Define specific, measurable testing objectives for this feature using **SMART criteria**
(Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).
Each goal should tie back to requirements from Section I and be independently verifiable.

**How to Define Good Testing Goals:**
- **Specific**: Clearly state what will be tested (not "test the feature" but "validate VM live migration
  with SR-IOV networks")
- **Measurable**: Define quantifiable success criteria (e.g., "95% of VM migrations complete within xxx seconds")
- **Achievable**: Realistic given resources and timeline
- **Relevant**: Directly supports feature acceptance criteria and user stories
- **Verifiable**: Can be objectively confirmed as complete

**Priority Levels:**
- **P0**: Blocking GA - must be complete before release
- **P1**: High priority - required for full feature coverage
- **P2**: Nice-to-have - can be deferred if timeline constraints exist -->

<!-- **Example - Functional Goals**:
- **[P0]** Verify VM live migration completes successfully with new network binding plugin across
  OVN-Kubernetes and secondary networks
- **[P1]** Validate hotplug/hotunplug operations work with new storage class without VM restart
- **[P0]** Confirm RBAC permissions model correctly restricts non-admin users from accessing
  cluster-wide configuration API
- **[P2]** Validate new metrics with real-time VM performance data (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O)

**Example - Quality Goals**:
- **[P0]** Verify VM live migration completes in <30 seconds for VMs with <8GB memory
  (performance baseline from VEP-XXXX)
- **[P1]** Confirm feature operates correctly in disconnected/air-gapped environments with local
  image registry
- **[P0]** Validate zero data loss during live migration under network latency up to 100ms

**Example - Integration Goals**:
- **[P0]** Verify backward compatibility: upgrade from OCP 4.19 to 4.20 preserves existing VM
  configurations without manual intervention
- **[P0]** Confirm interoperability with OpenShift Service Mesh when VMs use Istio sidecar injection
- **[P1]** Test integration with OpenShift monitoring stack: metrics appear in Prometheus,
  alerts fire correctly in Alertmanager -->

- **[P0]** Verify storage migration for offline VM
- **[P0]** Verify storage migration for offline VM and running VM in one migration plan
- **[P1]** Verify storage migration for offline VM with hotplug disk
- **[P1]** Verify retentionPolicy for offline VM storage migration

**Out of Scope (Testing Scope Exclusions)**

The following items are explicitly Out of Scope for this test cycle and represent intentional exclusions.
No verification activities will be performed for these items, and any related issues found will not be classified as defects for this release.

<!-- Explicitly document what is **out of scope** for testing.
This section define the test boundaries; for example: test coverage by other teams, edge cases, low priority, etc.
**Critical:** All out-of-scope items require explicit stakeholder agreement to prevent "I assumed you were testing
that" issues; each out-of-scope item must have PM/Lead sign-off.

- Items without stakeholder agreement are considered **risks** and must be escalated
- Review the items during Developer Handoff/QE Kickoff meeting

**Note:** Replace examples with your actual out-of-scope items. If there are no items; delete the checklist and add `None`-->

- [x] **Other storage migration tests**
  - *Rationale:* Existing storage migration tests already covered in 4.21 release
  - *PM/Lead Agreement:* [ ] Name/Date

- [x] **Storage migration UI tests**
  - *Rationale:* UI testing is owned by UI team
  - *PM/Lead Agreement:* [ ] Name/Date

#### **2. Test Strategy**

<!-- The following test strategy considerations must be reviewed and addressed. Mark [x] if applicable,
leave unchecked if not applicable (with justification in Details). Unchecked items without details
indicate incomplete review.

Note: Strategy defines *which types of testing* apply and the high-level approach. Goals (Section II.1) define the specific, measurable objectives.
Example: Strategy says "Performance testing is applicable — we will measure migration stuntime." Goals say "[P0] Verify VM stuntime during live migration is below 500ms." -->
